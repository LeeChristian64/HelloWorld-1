    <p>HTML is a programming language used in many webpages all over the Internet. 
    There are many different elements included in the .html language, the simplest of which I am using right now. 
      .html is a great language to learn webpage design in, because it is efficient and easy to use.</p><br>
    <p>I chose to take this class because it seemed very interesting to me. Learning about computers is something I enjoy doing, and I think this class will help me become better at using my computer. I think this class will also help me achieve my goals in college, and I think I will have fun in this class, even if I code different from everyone else.</p>
